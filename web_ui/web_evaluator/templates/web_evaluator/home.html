    <main>
        You will be asked to input a video URL that you'd like to choose a soundtrack for. At the moment ennIO can only
        handle 20 second videos. But don't worry if your video is larger than that! Simply input the starting timestamp
        of the portion of the video you want to score, and ennIO will extract the next 20 seconds.
